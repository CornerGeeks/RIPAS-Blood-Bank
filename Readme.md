App Ideas
---------
Based on comment on the event page: http://www.meetup.com/BruneiGeekMeet/events/156631312/

-Make mobile app and get notifications on FB update?
-Admin interface for RIPAS people to update? (will update Facebook and maybe a website as well?)
-Let users register blood type on their device which is saved in a server (can target specific blood types in notifications & perhaps a stat for their management to know the ratio of blood groups)
